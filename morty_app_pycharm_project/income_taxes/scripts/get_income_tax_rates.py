    Gets federal income tax rates for:
        - Single
        - Married (Separate)
        - Married (Joint)
        - Head of Household
    Things to keep in mind are the incomes have a constant added to them and then are multiplied by a percentage over
    a certain amount. For example:
        - The 12% federal income tax rate is $995 PLUS 12% of the amount over $9,950
        - The constant here is $995 and the percentage being multiplied is 12%
